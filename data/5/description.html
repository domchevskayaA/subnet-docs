  <strong>OPEN KAITO</strong> is an open-source, decentralized platform designed
  to foster collaboration in AI-driven research and development. Built on a
  transparent, community-driven ethos, OPEN KAITO facilitates the collective
  building and sharing of machine learning models, datasets, and research
  insights through decentralized protocols.

  The primary objective of Subnet 5 is to train and serve the best and most
  generalizable text-embedding models. Such text-embedding models can empower
  plenty of downstream applications such as semantic search, natural language
  understanding, and so on. Miners will be responsible for training models using
  an extensive corpus of textual data and serving the model in a low-latency and
  high-throughput way. These models will be utilized to generate high-quality
  embeddings for diverse text inputs. Validators will conduct rigorous
  evaluations of the models using multiple benchmarks. Performance comparisons
  will be made against existing SOTA text embedding models to ensure continuous
  improvement and competitiveness. Subnet users will gain access to cutting-edge
  text embedding models that are most generic and exceed SOTA performance. These
  models will be made publicly available through the validator API of Bittensor
  Subnet 5, facilitating widespread adoption and integration into various
  applications.

      Subnet dashboard with model performance growing curve, and comparison to
      OpenAI text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large models as
      baselines
    </li>
    <li>
      Subnet API for serving the miners trained model to the subnet users.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>V2 and further</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Extending the dataset</li>
    <li>
      Extending the evaluation incentive model to tasks like document re-ranking
