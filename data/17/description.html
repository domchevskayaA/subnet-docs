  (404—GEN) provides a platform to democratize 3D content creation — ultimately
  allowing anyone to create virtual worlds, games and (AR / vr / XR) experiences
  from text prompts. 404 uses open-source 3D content generation models: Gaussian
  Splatting, Neural Radiance Fields, and 3D Diffusion — to enable you to bring
  your dreams to life (in seconds).
</p>

<p>
  We offer free access to our Blender plugin, web app, and Discord bot, allowing
  you to easily prompt 3D models. We run on Bittensor's (sn17). In just 60 days,
  we will become the world's largest 3D dataset with a collection of (20M)
  continuously expanding and improving in quality over time
</p>
<p>
  (sn17) can dwarf web2 market leaders like Unity, Kitbash and Sketchfab by
  curating synthetic generation requests according to real-time demand vectors
  and storing models onchain. You have more control over quality and almost
  endless set of asset options to choose from.
</p>

<p>
  Our web app and discord bot provide output in (.ply and .mp4) formats, and the
  blender plugin generates objects directly in your viewport. Be one of the
  first who can benefit from almost instant asset generation.
