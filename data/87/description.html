<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  CheckerChain is a next-gen AI-powered crypto review platform that powers a
  trustless review consensus mechanism (tRCM). In tRCM protocol, anyone can
  participate but the protocol selects the reviewers arbitrarily to review a
  product. Selected reviewers can only get reward for their work when their
  review score falls in consensus range. Closer the consensus, more the reward.
</p>
<p>
  Reviewers have a higher probability to make their review closer to consensus
  only when they are honest. Any dishonest review by any reviewer falls outside
  of consensus. This generates no or least reward making dishonest reviews
  highly expensive to perform. This will eventually discourage such attackers
  from participating in the tRCM protocol.

<h2 id="subnet-introduction">Subnet Introduction</h2>
<p>
  CheckerChain subnet operates as a decentralized AI-powered prediction layer,
  continuously refining review scores through machine learning. It is structured
  into two key components: validators and miners. Validators play a crucial role
  in distributing product review tasks to miners and aggregating the Ground
  Truth ratings collected from the main platform. They evaluate miner-generated
  predictions, benchmarking them against the Ground Truth to ensure accuracy. By
  maintaining a competitive environment, validators score miners to optimize
  their models for better precision and efficiency.
</p>
<p>
  Miners, on the other hand, are responsible for running AI models that predict
  review scores for listed products. These models evolve over time by learning
  from past predictions and adjusting their algorithms based on discrepancies
  with the Ground Truth. Through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
  (RLHF), miners incorporate additional insights from validators and human
  reviewers, ensuring their models align more closely with real-world
  assessments. This continuous feedback loop allows the subnet to improve
  autonomously, reducing biases and increasing reliability in AI-driven ratings.
</p>
<p>
  The subnet follows a decentralized learning and incentive structure, where AI
  models start with predefined datasets and historical review scores. Over time,
  miners fine-tune their models by comparing predictions with Ground Truth data,
  optimizing accuracy through RLHF. Validators play a key role in integrating
  tRCM-based human feedback into the training process, refining AI predictions
  iteratively. As a result, miners that consistently produce high-accuracy
  predictions receive higher benchmarks and greater rewards, creating a
  self-reinforcing cycle of improvement.
</p>
<p>
  By combining tRCM human-decentralized ratings with AI-driven predictions,
  CheckerChainâ€™s subnet evolves into a self-learning, decentralized, and
  transparent review system. The open participation model allows anyone to join
  as a miner or validator, contributing to an AI-enhanced ecosystem that
  continuously adapts to real-world opinions. This fusion of human intelligence
  and AI automation ensures a fair, scalable, and corruption-resistant review
  platform, setting a new standard for decentralized trust in product
  evaluations.
