<h1 id="docs-insights-subnet">Docs-Insights Subnet</h1>
<p>
  The Docs-Insights is a decentralized system built for advanced document
  processing tasks. It combines multiple AI models—including vision models,
  language models, vision-language models (VLMs), and OCR engines—to accurately
  understand and extract information from documents. This subnet aims to offer a
  powerful, open-source alternative to proprietary tools, making document
  comprehension more accessible and efficient. By delivering key insights with a
  single click, it significantly reduces the time and effort required for
  document review.
