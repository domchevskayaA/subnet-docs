  "summary": "In today's world, documents come in all shapes and formats—many as scanned images or photographs—making accurate data extraction difficult and time-consuming. The Document Understanding Subnet is here to change that. Built on the Bittensor decentralized infrastructure, this subnet combines the power of vision models, language models, vision-language models (VLMs), OCR engines, and intelligent post-processing to transform complex documents into structured, meaningful data.",
