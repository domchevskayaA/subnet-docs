<h2 id="competition-tracks">Competition Tracks</h2>
<p>
  We are excited to announce our upcoming competition, featuring two distinct
  tracks:
</p>
<h3 id="1-research-track">1. Research Track</h3>
<p>
  This track aims to develop AI models capable of generating original scientific
  ideas, with a particular emphasis on proposing new methods in the AI domain.
  Participants will explore the potential of generative AI in devising
  innovative solutions to complex scientific problems.
</p>
<h3 id="2-demo-track">2. Demo Track</h3>
<p>
  The demo track serves as a platform to continuously produce AI models
  addressing specific problems, aiming to impress end-users and deliver value
  across various industries. We envision that, in the future, models from the
  research track could automate the ideation process for the demo track,
  reducing the need for manual brainstorming of intriguing AI topics.
</p>
<h2 id="ai-factory-conference">AI Factory Conference</h2>
<p>
  The AI Factory Conference is a decentralized research event that leverages the
  Bittensor network’s token emissions to incentivize high-quality AI research
  and peer review. Miners across the network are called upon to submit novel
  work, review their peers’ submissions, and collaboratively elevate the state
  of the art in machine learning and related fields.
</p>
<h2 id="community-workshop">Community Workshop</h2>
<p>
  Miners are invited to <strong>contribute knowledge</strong> by researching and
  presenting AI topics or papers (original or survey) in a concise video format.
  Approved presentations earn a share of Bittensor emissions and drive community
  learning.
