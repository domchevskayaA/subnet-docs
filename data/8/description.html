<h2>PTN Network Overview</h2>
<p>
  PTN is the most challenging & competitive network in the world. Our miners
  need to provide futures-based signals (long/short) that are highly efficient
  and effective across various markets to compete (forex, crypto, indices). The
  top miners are those that provide the most returns, while never exceeding
  certain drawdown limits.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Miners can submit LONG, SHORT, or FLAT signal for Forex, Crypto, and Indices
    trade pairs into the network. Currently supported trade pairs.
  </li>
  <li>Orders outside of market hours are ignored.</li>
  <li>Miners can only open 1 position per trade pair/symbol at a time.</li>
  <li>
    Positions are uni-directional. Meaning, if a position starts LONG (the first
    order it receives is LONG), it can't flip SHORT. If you try and have it flip
    SHORT (using more leverage SHORT than exists LONG) it will close out the
    position. You'll then need to open a second position which is SHORT with the
    difference.
  </li>
  <li>
    Position leverage is bound per trade_pair. If an order would cause the
    position's leverage to exceed the upper boundary, the position leverage will
    be clamped. Minimum order leverage is 0.001. Crypto positional leverage
    limit is [0.01, 0.5]. Forex/Indices positional leverage limit is [0.1, 5].
  </li>
  <li>
    Leverage is capped at 10 across all open positions in a miner's portfolio.
    Crypto position leverages are scaled by 10x when contributing to the
