  InfiniteVibe Media Production and Streaming
</h1>
<p>
  InfiniteVibe is an AI‚Äêdriven video and media studio putting Bittensor at the
  frontier of AI-Generated video production.
</p>
<p>
  Miners respond to tasks and create AI-generated videos using any model or
  means at their own disposal. Miner scoring and emissions are determined by
  real world user feedback e.g. paying for the SN output or views/engagement. As
  a way to grow awareness and attract the world&#39;s best creatives to SN89,
  the SN will first reward miners based on submissions engagement on the
  miner&#39;s own social media profiles. We will funnel traffic to
  infinitevibe.ai and tensorflix.ai - where a Beta list of organic tasks is
  being populated waiting for the SN reach quality output.
</p>
<p>
  Validators act as editor/producers, ensuring that miner quality progresses to
  the highest levels.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal is to align Validators and Miners closely with the quality of the SN
  product. As such Miners and Validators will be incentivized to hold Alpha
  either as collateral or stakeweight - and jointly benefit from monetization of
  the platform.
</p>
<h2 id="creative-direction">Creative Direction</h2>
<p>
  We will give miners full creative freedom and incentive to push the boundries
  of AI video production. Miners will be especially free to explore creatively
  at the start of the project, when the few guardrails on content will be
  present. Our goal in this phase is to cast the broadest net to attract top
  creatives and industry eyes. Eventually miner tasks will be more defined and
  miners will need to interpret and deliver what the market is asking for.
</p>
<p>
  InfiniteVibe creative network will fine tune over time to become a full
  fledged media production studio. AI is rewriting the book (again) on Hollywood
  and big Media-Tech, and this time Bittensor and InfiniteVibe will become the
  new leader as THE distributed, decentralized, and ultimately MOST CREATIVE
  player.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  InfiniteVibe implements a decentralized content creation and validation
  pipeline:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Miners</strong> submit video content to the SN and post the content
    on social media, and eventually the TensorFlix website
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validator</strong> score submissions by their engagement on the
    video traffic. Validators also: verify content is 100% AI generated, zero
    illicit or hate speech, traffic is from real humans and not bots.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Coordination</strong> happens through Bittensor blockchain and
    GitHub gists
  </li>
</ul>
