    >Decentrally Validated Simulation of Automated Trading in Artificially
    Intelligent Markets: Risk-Averse Agent Optimization</strong
  >
</p>
<h2 id="task">Task</h2>
<p>
  You can soon partake in a powerful decentralized simulation by developing
  trading algorithms in any language and enter them into the taos.im
  token-intentivized races (refer to README). In doing so, you can take
  advantage of deep limit-order-book (dLOB) data, and with limitations to be
  relaxed later on, develop deep-intelligent high-frequency trading (dHFT) type
  of faster strategies.
</p>
<p>
  On TAOS, the specific task is to create reward-risk maximizing algorithms that
  consistently outperform the other agents. These token-incentivized races
  operate 24/7 like real crypto or FX markets, with many race-simulations run in
  parallel to maximize the statistical significance of the average. The best
  race-performers are likely to be attractive candidates at real-world
  exchanges. The decentralized TAOS simulation applies open-source stylized
  agents combined with complex and intelligent AI agents, producing increasingly
  realistic dLOB data. This, in turn, allows traders (later even dHFTrs),
  exchanges, and market regulators to run more refined experiments on their own
  or upon request in a economically highly efficient manner, leading to better
  market quality.

<h2 id="feat">Feat</h2>
<p>
  The team has years of experience in high-frequency data recording, AI, and its
  implementation in market-making simulations. Now, we are taking certain feats
  to the forefront of decentralized AI:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      [C++ CODE] The developed subnet validator logic in C++ is special in the
      Bittensor ecosystem; C++ code is applied to achieve the maximum level of
      efficiency and number of simultaneous runs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      [RESEARCH] The team includes a high-frequency data expert with 20+ years
      of experience in agent-based modeling, trading, and market microstructure,
      and others with a doctorate degree.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      [HF-DATA] The simulations allow for L3 market-by-order data to be used by
      the AI-Agents, motivated by the fact that deep-level HF-data may be useful
      in AI prediction (refer to
      <a href="https://taos.im/files/taos-im-paper.pdf">EVIDENCE</a>).

  email us at to@taos.im. You can also partake in running the framework by
  staking and earning dividends; for info on investments, email us at
  stake@taos.im, read Bittensor docs, or use &quot;CQ&quot; to do it yourself.
