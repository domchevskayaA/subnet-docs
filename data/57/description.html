<h2>🌎 Welcome to Gaia! 🌍</h2>

<h3>What is it ? </h3>
<p>
  The core goal of Gaia is to create a modular platform for chaining tasks together, aggregating outputs, and building useful, actionable information from small expert geospatial models. Think of Gaia like a decoupled "mixture of experts" model - not a singular model per se, but a framework for combining the outputs of many expert models into defined, useful tasks.
