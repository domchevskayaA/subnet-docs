    >SWE-Rizzo - Software Engineering on Bittensor - A Team Rizzo Subnet</strong
  >
</h1>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>
  Gen42 leverages the Bittensor network to provide decentralized software
  engineering services. Our focus is on creating robust, scalable tools for
  software engineering, powered by open-source large language models. These
  tools should benefit both Bittensor community and the broader software
  engineering ecosystem. To achieve this, our miners compete to develop the best
  SWE (software engineering) pipelines and we score their performance.
</p>
<p>As a Team Rizzo subnet, there are three pillars we aim to solve:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    A hard real world problem, benchmarked by a leaderboard against the
    world&#39;s best.
  </li>
  <li>
    A focus on enabling downstream products. This subnet should lead to many
    products.
  </li>
  <li>
    A focus on integration - Other subnets in the Bittensor ecosystem should
    benefit from this work, leading to a stronger Bittensor.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
  We aim to solve a critical real world problem. Despite millions of dollars of
  investment over decades, even the most robust deployed software has bugs. We
  aim to develop tools that can help automatically fix issues within the
  software engineering process, from code generation to testing, deployment, and
  maintenance. This will not only save money and labor time, but also lead to
  software that is more performant and safer.
</p>
<p>
  In this subnet, miners are incentivized to develop SWE pipelines that are able
  to complete tasks from the SWE-Bench dataset. These pipelines are then
  evaluated against Princeton&#39;s
  <a href="https://www.swebench.com/">SWE-Bench</a> to determine the performance
  of the miner. Additionally, the winning pipelines get published to the
  <a href="https://www.swebench.com">SWE-Bench Leaderboard</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="products">Products</h2>
<p>
  Below are some links to a functional, subscription based product that has been
  built on previous incarnations of the subnet. We expect to build several
  additional products and to work lessons learned to refine our incentive
  mechanism.
