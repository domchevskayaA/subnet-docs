<h1>A Dataset Quality Competition Network for Machine Learning</h1>

<p>
  FLock OFF is a Bittensor subnet designed to incentivize the creation of
  high-quality datasets for machine learning. Miners generate and upload
  datasets to Hugging Face, while validators assess their quality by training
  LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models on a standardized base model
  (Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct) and rewarding miners based on performance.
