  As more and more of our daily lives revolve around consuming content online,
  more emphasis is placed on making it as high-quality as possible. The demand
  for better quality audio thus grows by the day.
</p>
<p>
  That being said, speech enhancement is a rather complex field of study. For
  instance, with the task of denoising audio, separating the speech we want from
  background noise requires training models capable of distinguishing the two
  from each other under many different circumstances.
</p>
<p>
  However, what we find is that much of this technology is hidden behind a
  paywall, when in reality all the components necessary to open the floodgates
  for open-source innovation are already in place.
</p>
<p>
  SoundsRight is dedicated to incentivizing the research and development of
  non-proprietary speech enhancement models through daily fine-tuning
  competitions, powered by the decentralized and incentivized Bittensor
  ecosystem.

  The subnetâ€™s miners upload models to HuggingFace, and validators benchmark
  them on a fresh dataset generated every day. The miner who submits the best
  model then receives a steady emission of TAO.

  Competitions for Multiple Use-Cases
</h3>
<p>
  The subnet hosts competitions for both denoising and dereverberation tasks at
  a 16 kHz sample rate, and are looking to expand to 48 kHz competitions in
  upcoming updates. This provides a wide variety of applications for the models
  provided by the subnet.

<h3 id="winner-takes-all-competitions">Winner-Takes-All Competitions</h3>
<p>
  The winner-takes-all format has a few implications for the subnet. The
  substantial rewards this creates provide miners a much greater incentive to
  produce quality models. The format, when combined with the validation
  mechanism, also deters miner factions by rendering model duplication
  unprofitable and unsustainable.
</p>
<h3 id="continuous-dataset-generation">Continuous Dataset Generation</h3>
<p>
  Subnet validators generate a new dataset for every new competition, ensuring
  that miner models are not susceptible to overfitting during the benchmarking
  process. Miners can also generate datasets for themselves during the
  fine-tuning process, providing them with the ability to perpetually train
  their models on new data.
