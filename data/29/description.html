<h2>Coldint: Maximizing Collective AI Training Efforts</h2>

<p>
  Our mission is to maximize the collective training efforts of the Bittensor
  community by incentivizing the sharing of models, knowledge, insights, and
  code.
</p>

<h2>Main Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Train and share state-of-the-art models and code to contribute to real-world
    applications.
  </li>
  <li>Incentivize both individual and collective effort.</li>
  <li>Maintain a consistent, high pace of high quality iterations.</li>
  <li>Uphold transparency and fairness among all stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Objectives</h2>

<h3>1. Train and Share State-of-the-Art Models and Code</h3>
<p>
  A major goal of Coldint is to contribute something to the world. Miners are
  primarily incentivized for their contribution in the form of trained models
  that are publicly shared. A secondary incentive is given to miners or other
  contributors for sharing insights by contributing to the canonical miner
  codebase. This may range from pointing out bugs, to adding small features and
  optimizations, and to rewriting large parts of code.
</p>

<h3>2. Incentivize Both Individual and Collective Effort</h3>
<p>
  By rewarding small improvements, individual miners are incentivized to
  regularly share their improved work. This in turn enables other miners to
  build upon earlier contributions, accelerating the collective effort. Code
  contributions that enable combining individual training efforts into an even
  better combined model will be highly rewarded, as this will truly unlock the
  collective potential.
</p>

<h3>3. Maintain a Consistent Pace of High Quality Iterations</h3>
<p>Within Coldint, iterations are done in three main areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Models are improved continuously by miners</li>
  <li>
    Training objectives are scheduled to change periodically, at a steady pace
  </li>
  <li>Validator and miner codebases are continuously refined</li>
</ul>
<p>
  All stakeholders can participate in improving each of these areas. This leads
  to a dynamic community which promotes the exchange of ideas, insights and
  knowledge.
</p>

<h3>4. Uphold Transparency and Fairness</h3>
<p>
  Coldint strives to be transparent by publicizing miner code, training
  objective schedules, awarded bounties and research results. Coldint invites
  community members to suggest innovative training goals. Mitigating steps are
  taken to prevent well known "metagaming" tactics from earning any reward. If
  new gaming opportunities arise that would lead to misalignment between miner
  and subnet objective, bug bounties should ensure that reporting bugs is as
  lucrative as exploiting them. Bug bounties are rewards for code contributions,
  and will be publicized to elicit additional bug reports and fixes.
