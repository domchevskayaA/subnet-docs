<h2>Tensorplex Dojo Subnet: Democratizing AI Dataset Creation</h2>

<p>
  The development of open-source AI models is often hindered by the lack of
  high-quality human-generated datasets. Closed-source AI developers, aiming to
  reduce data collection costs, have created significant social and economic
  equity challenges, with workers being paid less than $2 per hour for mentally
  and emotionally taxing tasks. The benefits of these models have been
  concentrated among a select few, exacerbating inequalities among contributors.
</p>

<p>
  Enter Tensorplex Dojo Subnet â€” an open platform designed to crowdsource
  high-quality human-generated datasets. Powered by Bittensor, the Dojo Subnet
  addresses these challenges by allowing anyone to earn TAO by labeling data or
  providing human-preference data. This approach democratizes the collection of
  human preference data, addressing existing equity issues and paving the way
  for more inclusive and ethical AI development.

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<p>
  To ensure the quality and integrity of the data collected, Dojo introduces
  several novel features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Synthetic Task Generation:</strong> Unique tasks are generated by
    state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to collect human feedback
    data, which can be used to improve open-source models.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Synthetic Ground Truth Validation Mechanism:</strong> Validators can
    synthetically generate partial ground truths, allowing them to determine the
    quality of responses provided by individual participants.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Obfuscation:</strong> Techniques to prevent sybil attacks and ensure
    contributions are genuinely human.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>

<p>The Dojo Subnet offers multiple use cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Synthetically Generated Tasks:</strong> These tasks can bootstrap
    the human participant pool and can be used for model training or fine-tuning
    from the outset.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cross-subnet Validation:</strong> Validators can use responses to
    rate the quality of outputs across other Bittensor subnets, thereby
    incentivizing miners to improve their performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>External Data Acquisition:</strong> Entities outside the Bittensor
    ecosystem can tap into the subnet to acquire high-quality human-generated
    data.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  By creating an open platform for gathering human-generated datasets,
  Tensorplex Dojo Subnet aims to solve the challenges of quality control, human
  verification, and sybil attack prevention while promoting a more equitable
  distribution of benefits in AI development.
</p>

<h3>Benefits to participants contributing through Dojo</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Open platform:</strong> Anyone capable can contribute, ensuring
    broad participation and diverse data collection.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Flexible work environment:</strong> Participants enjoy the freedom
    to work on tasks at their convenience from any location.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Quick payment:</strong> Rewards are streamed consistently to
    participants, as long as they complete sufficient tasks within a stipulated
    deadline and have them accepted by the subnet.
  </li>
</ul>
