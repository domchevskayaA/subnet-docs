<h2>Sportstensor: Decentralized Sports Prediction</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to Sportstensor, where cutting-edge technology meets sports analytics.
  We're pioneering the world's most accurate decentralized sports prediction
  algorithm, powered by the Bittensor network. Our subnet tackles the challenges
  of high-quality data sourcing, complex data analysis and limited access to
  advanced machine learning models.
</p>

<p>
  Traditionally, the most accurate sports prediction models have been
  proprietary, restricting innovation to isolated silos. Collectively, miners
  and validators are redefining what's possible in this field with the
  collaborative power of decentralization.
