  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a critical field in machine learning that
  focuses on automating the design of artificial neural network architectures.
  As deep nerual network models become increasingly complex and computationally
  expensive, the significance of NAS grows. The primary goal of NAS is to
  identify the optimal model that not only maximizes accuracy for a given
  use-case but also minimizes the number of parameters and the computational
  cost, measured in Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). However, performing such
  searches can be very resource-intensive, often requiring days or weeks of
  computation on hundreds of GPUs to find an optimal model. NASChain aims to
  address these challenges by leveraging the power of the Bittensor network and
  an innovative incentive mechanism. This approach distributes NAS tasks among
  participants (referred to as miners), thereby decentralizing the computational
  effort and potentially reducing the time and resources required for finding
  efficient and effective neural architectures.
