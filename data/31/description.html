  The future of decentralized markets depends not only on infrastructure but
  also on timely, crowd-driven, and actionable insights. Candles introduces a
  new paradigm for on-chain market sentiment by merging predictive intelligence
  with gamified participation. Built as a Bittensor subnet (Subnet 31), Candles
  enables users to forecast the directional outcomes of crypto market candles
  (green or red) across hourly, daily, and weekly timeframes. This mechanism
  transforms collective intuition into quantifiable, tradable asset sentiment.

  Candles’ innovative, dual-structured ecosystem sets it apart: miners generate
  structured predictions using machine learning or heuristics, while public
  participants enter prediction pools using the S31 Alpha token. These two
  participant groups are tightly integrated—miners are scored in part by their
  performance and emissions, which are recycled into those same pools to sustain
  activity and reward users. This design aligns incentives across roles while
  creating a transparent, self-sustaining ecosystem.

  Beyond its native utility within Bittensor, Candles is designed for global
  adoption. It actively appeals to users from the broader crypto space —
  Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and beyond — by offering easy participation,
  eventually accepting cross-chain payment support, and familiar gamified
  formats inspired by daily fantasy sports pools. Whether you’re a DeFi trader,
  data analyst, or crypto newcomer, Candles provides a compelling and intuitive
  way to engage with market sentiment while earning rewards.

  Moreover, the protocol is designed for long-term sustainability. With
  mechanisms such as fee recycling, emissions reinvestment, Alpha burning
  events, and recurring membership revenue, Candles ensures that the health and
  growth of its ecosystem are integrated into its core economics. Strategic
  partnerships, subnet sponsorships, and premium membership tiers further
  enhance added value, all while providing clear and scalable pathways for
  adoption and growth.
</p>
<p>
  In a digital world overflowing with data, Candles transforms attention into
  signal and participation into predictive power. By enabling users to harness
  the wisdom of crowds through decentralized infrastructure, Candles is poised
  to become a foundational engine for sentiment analysis and predictive pooling,
  not just within Bittensor but across the entire digital landscape.
