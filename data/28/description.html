<p>
  Foundry is launching Foundry S&P 500 Oracle to incentivize miners to make
  predictions on the S&P 500 price frequently throughout trading hours.
</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Validators send miners a timestamp (a future time)</li>
  <li>
    Miners predict the close price of the S&P 500 for the next six 5-minute
    intervals
  </li>
  <li>
    Miners respond with their prediction for the S&P 500 price at the given time
  </li>
  <li>
    Validators store miner predictions and calculate scores after predictions
    mature
  </li>
  <li>Miners are ranked against each other, fostering competition</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Decisions</h2>
<p>
  A Bittensor integration into financial markets will expose Bittensor to the
  largest system in the world: the global economy. The S&P 500 serves as a
  perfect starting place for financial predictions given its utility and name
  recognition.
</p>

<h3>Financial market predictions were chosen for three main reasons:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Utility:</strong> Financial markets provide a massive userbase of
    professional traders, wealth managers, and individuals alike
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Objective Rewards Mechanism:</strong> By tying the rewards mechanism
    to an external source of truth (Yahoo Finance's S&P Price), the
    defensibility of the subnet regarding gamification is quite strong
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adversarial Environment:</strong> The competitive nature will allow
    for significant diversity of models. Miners will be driven to acquire
    different datasets, implement various training methods, and utilize diverse
    model architectures to develop the most performant models
  </li>
</ol>
