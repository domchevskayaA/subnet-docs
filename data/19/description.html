<h1 id="subnet-19-">Subnet 19 ðŸ‘€</h1>
<p>
  Subnet 19 is decentralised inference of AI models. We call ourselves
  <code>Nineteen ðŸ‘€</code>. Bittensor has the Nineteen of being the most
  powerful force in AI, powering the world through decentralisation. SN19 is all
  about fulfilling that <code>Nineteen</code> by getting decentralised AI into
  the hands of all.
</p>
<p>
  We have a focus on inference, currently offering access to the best open
  source LLM&#39;s, Image generation models (including those trained on datasets
  from subnet 19), and other miscellaneous models such as embedding models.
  We&#39;ve even home grown and open sourced our own workflows, such as avatar
  generation.

<h1 id="decentralisation">Decentralisation</h1>
<p>
  Nothing is more important than decentralisation - we must be decentralised. We
  rely on no centralised API&#39;s - the miners&#39; and validators&#39; all run
  their own models. No single provider can bring us down.
</p>
<h2 id="decentralised-miners">Decentralised miners</h2>
<p>
  Miners all run open source models on any hardware they choose. They&#39;re
  incentivised by three things:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Volume (amount of tokens, for example)</li>
  <li>Speed of requests (Measured in Tokens/s, for example)</li>
  <li>Quality of requests (Measured by accuracy compared to base model)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  They&#39;re incentivised over a range of tasks, independently of each other.
  Miners have the option of choosing which tasks they want to run, and the
  volume they want to run for each. The more volume they have, the more rewards
  they get!
</p>
<h2 id="decentralised-validators">Decentralised Validators</h2>
<p>
  Validators operate as decentralised access points to the network. In a
  one-click fashion, Validators can offer up their miner access to the world,
  with a clear path to monetisation.
</p>
<p>
  They check and score the miners through &#39;Checking servers&#39; that they
  run themselves on their own hardware. No centralisation to be found here.
</p>
<h2 id="organic-scoring-is-a-primary-citizen">
  Organic scoring is a primary citizen
</h2>
<p>
  All organic requests can be scored, and checked for the upmost quality. Not
  only that, but we always keep track of the miners who are most likely to be
  available to answer organic requests, meaning the lowest latency and highest
  reliability possible! The user experience is the most important thing about
  SN19 - allowing validators to monetise and the world to experience Bittensor.
