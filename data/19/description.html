  Subnet 19 is decentralised inference of AI models. We call ourselves Vision
  ðŸ‘€. Bittensor has the vision of being the most powerful force in AI, powering
  the world through decentralisation. SN19 is all about fulfilling that Vision
  by getting decentralised AI into the hands of all. We have a focus on
  inference, currently offering access to the best open source LLM's, Image
  generation models (including those trained on datasets from subnet 19), and
  other miscellaneous models such as embedding models. We've even home grown and
  open sourced our own workflows, such as avatar generation.

<h2>Decentralization</h2>
<p>
  Nothing is more important than the Vision - we must be decentralised. We rely
  on no centralised API's - the miners' and validators' all run their own
  models. No single provider can bring us down.
