<h3>Powering a Trading Nexus with SignalPlus</h3>
<p>
  Built by an exceptional team of former banking and technology veterans, the
  SignalPlus terminal is the industry's leading derivative trading and options
  risk management platform that is well recognized by crypto's largest players
  and exchanges. With a professional suite of automated and industrial-grade
  tools available to all, we now have a ready-made platform and built-in
  measurement tools to power the Bittensor network. Never has such a
  level-playing field been offered to the every day user, allowing each trader
  to focus on refining their craft rather than being inhibited by inadequate
  tools. As a result, traders are empowered to develop better trading frameworks
  rather than risk tools, ensuring better trading results and quality data to
  train the machine learning processes.

<h3>The SignalPlus Value Proposition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Authenticity of Trading Data</b> - In any performance evaluation, the
    authenticity of the trading data is paramount. On-chain data alone is not
    able to recognize trading irregularities or factitious trades that were made
    to 'game' the system. If miners were allowed to upload their own trading
    records, there is no reliable way to ensure those records werenâ€™t
    fabricated. Miners could simply generate false data to inflate their
    performance, making the entire system vulnerable to manipulation. At the
    same time, it would be unrealistic for miners to give validators direct
    access to their personal trading accounts, given obvious security and
    privacy concerns. This is where SignalPlus can help to break the deadlock to
    act as a neutral but trusted conduit to verify trading records. SignalPlus
    will act as a trusted intermediary through its integrated connectivity with
    all the major trading exchanges. The platform is technically capable of
    verifying all trading data to ensure that they are from real accounts with
    commercial executions, ensuring the sanctity of PNL records. The platform
    will strive to ensure the fairness and integrity of the competition,
    allowing the Bittensor subnet to operate with trustworthy data and develop
    reliable results.
