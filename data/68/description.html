<h1>NOVA: Decentralized Drug Discovery Subnet</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Drug discovery is traditionally slow, expensive, and risky. Conventional
  pipelines can take over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a single
  drug to market [4]. Challenges include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Inefficiencies:</strong> Incremental chemical modifications rather
    than breakthrough innovations are common.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Centralization:</strong> Legacy systems suffer from siloed data and
    limited computational scalability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>High Cost and Risk:</strong> High failure rates add enormous
    uncertainty and expense.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  NOVA addresses these challenges by leveraging the decentralized power of the
  Bittensor network [5]. By incentivizing the use of ML-based active learning
  and heuristic adaptive search methods, NOVA transforms drug discovery into a
  scalable, efficient search process. Every participant—miner or validator—plays
  a role in rapidly screening a billion-sized molecular library, optimizing the
  search for high-affinity, synthesizable drug candidates.
</p>

<h2>2. NOVA Subnet Architecture</h2>
<h3>Overview in the Bittensor Ecosystem</h3>
<p>
  NOVA is one of several specialized subnets within the Bittensor network. While
  other subnets focus on tasks such as pretraining (SN9), data collection
  (SN13), and protein folding (SN25), NOVA is dedicated to early-stage drug
  discovery.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Objective:</strong> Find the best molecule in the shortest amount of
  time. NOVA V1 challenges miners to find a molecule from the database provided
  with the highest binding affinity to the protein target selected for each
  challenge. Over time, the challenge will evolve into a multi-parametric
  optimization exercise that mirrors the process of drug discovery with multiple
  targets and key physicochemical properties that maximize the likelihood of
  eventual drug approval.
</p>

<p>Its architecture comprises three major components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Miners:</strong> Deploy and execute optimized search methods over
    the vast chemical space of the SAVI 2020 database hunting promising
    molecules using for example ML-based active learning and/or heuristic
    adaptive search methods. Recent approaches such as PyrMD: Accelerated
    Chemical Space Exploration Using Active Sampling [8] and MolPAL: An Active
    Learning Framework for Molecular Property Prediction [10] illustrate how
    active sampling and iterative refinement can efficiently guide exploration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validators:</strong> Nodes that evaluate submitted molecules using
    the Deterministic Oracle.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Deterministic Oracle (PSICHIC):</strong> A state-of-the-art
    model that assigns a binding affinity score to each molecule, serving as the
    "ground truth" for the competition.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Interactions</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Mining Process:</strong><br />
  Miners extract candidate molecules from SAVI 2020. They refine their
  strategies over time by using adaptive search techniques (e.g., substructure
  searches, heuristic filters) or, when applicable, ML-based active learning
  methods that are adjusted based on the Deterministic Oracle predictions [2,
  3]. (See Appendix A for Miners Concept Logic).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Validation Process:</strong><br />
  Validators score the submissions for block n at the end of block n+1 using
  PSICHIC, ensuring objective and transparent evaluation. (See Appendix B for
  Miners Concept Logic).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Reward Allocation:</strong><br />
  At the end of each challenge, the miner that has presented the molecule with
  the highest score (binding affinity to the protein) will receive the reward.
  (See Appendix C for more on the reward allocation rationale).
</p>

<h2>3. PSICHIC as the Deterministic Oracle</h2>
<h3>What is PSICHIC?</h3>
<p>
  PSICHIC is an advanced prediction model that estimates protein–ligand binding
  affinity using minimal input—typically the protein sequence and the molecule's
  representation (such as SMILES) [2]. PSICHIC's reproducible, deterministic
  output predictions provide a clear, objective score, that combined with its
  high customizability and open-source nature, positions it as the ideal
  candidate as the first Deterministic Oracle.
</p>

<h3>Role in NOVA</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Deterministic Evaluation:</strong><br />
  PSICHIC's fixed output for any given molecule (given a fixed model version)
  ensures that all submissions are scored objectively.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Motivating Optimized Search:</strong><br />
  Because the SAVI 2020 database is so large, it's not practical to evaluate
  every molecule by brute force in the defined time for each challenge. This
  forces miners to develop intelligent strategies—whether through ML-based
  active learning or adaptive search using heuristic methods—to hone in on the
  best candidates to be evaluated through PSICHIC predictions.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Standard for Success:</strong><br />
  In each challenge, the candidate's PSICHIC score is the definitive metric for
  success, making it the cornerstone of the competitive process.
</p>

<h2>4. Leveraging the SAVI 2020 Database</h2>
<h3>The SAVI Advantage</h3>
<p>
  The SAVI 2020 database is an ultra-large, synthesizable virtual library
  generated by applying expert-curated reaction rules to known chemical building
  blocks [1]. This process yields approximately 1.75 billion compounds that are:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Synthesizable:</strong><br />
  Each molecule comes with a clear synthetic route, ensuring that computational
  hits can be readily synthesized and tested in the lab.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Chemically Realistic:</strong><br />
  SAVI's compounds are grounded in established chemical reactions, ensuring they
  are practical for real-world drug development, reducing the odds of spending
  time evaluating inaccessible chemical matter while also aiming for
  exceptionally high chemical diversity.
</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Scalability:</strong><br />
  SAVI 2020 vastly expands the searchable chemical space beyond what traditional
  datasets offer.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Practicality:</strong><br />
  Because every candidate was previously evaluated in terms of synthesizability,
  any hit identified by miners is actionable, enabling a swift transition from
  virtual screening to experimental validation.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Democratization:</strong><br />
  As an open-source resource, SAVI aligns with NOVA's decentralized ethos,
  providing all participants with the same high-quality foundation for
  innovation.
</p>

<h2>5. Drug Discovery as a Search Problem</h2>
<h3>Reframing Drug Discovery</h3>
<p>
  NOVA transforms drug discovery into a well-defined optimization
  challenge—finding the molecule with the highest binding affinity to a target
  protein. Instead of a random trial-and-error approach, the process is
  structured as follows:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Optimization Objective:</strong><br />
  Maximize the binding affinity score provided by PSICHIC [2].
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Iterative Refinement:</strong><br />
  Miners use feedback from PSICHIC to refine their search strategy. This
  iterative process can be driven by ML-based active learning—as demonstrated in
  Traversing Chemical Space with Active Deep Learning [7]—or by adaptive search
  using creative search heuristics.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Heuristic-Driven Exploration:</strong><br />
  Even without complex ML models, miners can use creative search heuristics—such
  as prioritizing molecules with known active substructures performing well
  under the Deterministis Oracle evaluation—to focus on the most promising
  regions of the chemical space. Approaches like PyrMD: Accelerated Chemical
  Space Exploration Using Active Sampling [8] and MolPAL: An Active Learning
  Framework for Molecular Property Prediction [10] provide compelling examples
  of how targeted sampling and iterative feedback can dramatically reduce
  computational costs and enhance screening efficiency.
</p>

<h3>Comparable Large-Scale Searches</h3>
<p>
  This approach is similar to methods used in neural architecture search or
  reinforcement learning, where systems iteratively improve based on feedback.
  By combining active learning and adaptive search, NOVA efficiently narrows
  down a billion-molecule space to the most promising candidates.
</p>

<h2>6. The Competitive Mining Model</h2>
<h3>Challenge Format</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Per-Block Submissions:</strong><br />
  Miners submit candidate molecules selected from SAVI 2020, with the caveat
  that each submission overwrites the previous one. This will ensure that miners
  only submit a new molecule when they find a higher affinity score.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Challenge Rounds:</strong><br />
  Over the challenge period (360 blocks), miners continuously refine their
  submissions using their chosen search strategies. Rewards will be calculated
  to determine the highest scoring miner, with lower reward values in the
  beginning of the challenge and larger values towards the end of the challenge.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Winner-Takes-All Reward:</strong><br />
  At the end of each block, validators evaluate each miner's active submission
  with PSICHIC [2] and rank miners based on their scores. The miner with the
  highest binding affinity score wins the reward. If the same molecule is
  submitted by two different miners or two molecules with the same binding
  affinity were submitted by different miners, the miner that submitted it first
  wins the sub-challenge.
</p>

<h3>Implications</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Intelligent Strategy Requirement:</strong><br />
  With only one active submission allowed at a time and a winner-takes-all
  reward, miners must also focus on quality, not only quantity.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong><br />
  The competitive nature drives miners to refine their strategies iteratively,
  using feedback from PSICHIC to guide enhancements.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Transparency and Fairness:</strong><br />
  Every submission is evaluated objectively, ensuring a level playing field for
  all participants.
</p>

<h2>7. Validation Mechanism and Incentive Alignment</h2>
<h3>Validation Workflow</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Miner Submissions:</strong><br />
  Each miner can submit up to one candidate molecule at any given time. This
  means that miners are incentivized to make another submission only when they
  find a better candidate.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>PSICHIC Evaluation:</strong><br />
  At the end of each block (~12 seconds), validators perform an evaluation of
  the binding affinity score of each miner's active submission. Winner molecules
  and their binding affinities are presented to the community on the
  leaderboard, further refining the community's search strategies and
  incentivizing competition.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Winner Determination:</strong><br />
  Every 360 blocks, validators define the best miner based on the best score.
  Ties are solved by prioritizing who submitted the best performing molecule
  earlier. The candidate with the highest PSICHIC score receives the TAO reward
  for that chunk, which is expected to be lower in the beginning of the
  challenge and higher towards the end, incentivizing continuous participation.
</p>

<h3>Preventing Exploitation</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Objective, Fixed Scoring:</strong><br />
  By using PSICHIC as the Deterministic Oracle we ensure the elimination of
  subjective bias in the definition of winner molecules given its deterministic
  predictions.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Spam/Attacks Prevention:</strong><br />
  Limiting submissions to one active submission at any given time incentivizes
  miners to focus on quality rather than indiscriminate volume of submissions.
</p>

<h3>Alignment of Incentives</h3>

  fine-tuned versions for specific challenges.
</p>

<h2>8. TAO Token Incentive Model</h2>
<h3>Economic Framework</h3>
<p>NOVA leverages alpha TAO tokens to reward innovation and efficiency:</p>

<p>
  <strong>Winner-Takes-All:</strong><br />
  The miner with the highest PSICHIC score at the end of each challenge wins the
  alpha TAO reward for that chunk. Reward values will grow as the challenge
  progresses, incentivizing continuous participation. And aligning the
  incentives with rewarding exceptional search mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Performance-Based Scaling:</strong><br />
  Consistently high-performing miners build reputations, unlocking higher-value
  challenges over time.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Validator Rewards:</strong><br />
  Validators earn fees for fast, reliable, accurate and objective evaluation
  using the Deterministic Oracle, reinforcing honest processing.
</p>

<h3>Network-Wide Impact</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Alignment of Interests:</strong><br />
  Miners and validators are incentivized to act in ways that enhance the overall
  quality and scientific output of the network, maximizing the potential of IP
  generation.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Sustainable Growth:</strong><br />
  As more participants join, cumulative contributions drive both scientific and
  economic progress.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Collective Knowledge:</strong><br />
  Each round enriches a shared repository of high-potential drug candidates,
  further accelerating drug discovery.
</p>

<h2>9. Network Effects and Future Growth</h2>
<h3>Scaling the Ecosystem</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Increased Participation:</strong><br />
  More miners and validators mean greater collective computational power,
  enabling a deeper exploration of chemical space.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Cumulative Data Enrichment:</strong><br />
  Each validated candidate adds to the network's repository of molecules–target
  interactions, refining future search and prediction strategies.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Interoperability with Other Subnets:</strong><br />
  NOVA challenges hold potential to benefit from integration with other
  Bittensor subnets (e.g. SN9, SN25, SN13), creating a synergistic ecosystem
  that amplifies innovation.
</p>

<h3>Future Directions</h3>

<p>
  <strong>ADME/Tox Integration:</strong><br />
  Expand the validation process to include additional metrics such as
  pharmacokinetics and toxicity. A drug may have a high binding affinity to a
  desired protein target but lack other properties in order to become a
  successful therapeutic.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Wet lab validation:</strong><br />
  Top miner submissions will be compiled in tokenized libraries, synthesized,
  and tested in wet labs. Results from in vitro and in vivo assays will be used
  to further the drug development process and used to fine tune the oracle
  model; thus, improving the predictive power of the subnet.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Community-Driven Innovation:</strong><br />
  Foster open-source collaboration to continuously refine miner algorithms and
  share best practices.
</p>
