<h2>WOMBO: Leading the Consumer AI Revolution</h2>

<p>
  WOMBO is one of the world's leading consumer AI companies, and early believers
  in generative AI.
</p>

<p>We've launched two #1 apps, WOMBO and Dream, which have been:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Downloaded over 200M times</li>
  <li>Reached #1 on app stores in 100+ countries</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These results were only possible due to the immense capabilities of bleeding
  edge generative AI techniques and the power of open source AI. Our unique
  understanding of this research space through a consumer entertainment lens
  allows us to craft products people love to use and share.
</p>

<p>
  We are at the very beginning of the Synthetic Media Revolution, which will
  completely transform how people create, consume, and distribute content. We're
  building the apps and infrastructure to power this change and bring AI
  entertainment potential to the masses.
</p>

<h3>What is the goal?</h3>
<p>
  The EdgeMaxxing subnet aims to create the world's most optimized AI models for
  consumer devices, starting with Stable Diffusion XL on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX
  4090.
</p>

<p>
  The subnet will expand to support optimization for various end devices,
  models, and modalities overtime.
</p>

<h3>Key Benefits of Optimized Models</h3>
<p>
  Optimizing AI models is crucial to realizing a vision of decentralized AI.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Enabling these advanced models to run on
    consumer devices, from smartphones to laptops, bringing AI capabilities to
    everyone.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Decentralization:</strong> Allowing millions of users to contribute
    their computing power, rather than relying on a small number of powerful
    miners, creating a truly distributed AI network.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  By optimizing popular models like LLAMA3 and Stable Diffusion, we transform
  idle computing resources into valuable contributors to a global AI network.
  This democratizes both AI usage and creation, offering earning opportunities
  to millions.
</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>
  Our mission is to create the world's most optimized AI models for edge
  devices, democratizing access to powerful AI capabilities. Here's our path
  forward:
</p>

<h4>Phase 1: Foundation (Current)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Perfect contest and benchmarking mechanisms</li>
  <li>
    Establish a robust framework for measuring model performance across hardware
  </li>
  <li>
    Cultivate a community of world-class miners skilled in optimizing models for
    edge devices
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Phase 2: Expansion</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support a diverse range of AI models, pipelines, and consumer-grade hardware
  </li>
  <li>Develop tools to lower entry barriers for new participants</li>
  <li>Integrate initial set of optimized models into the w.ai platform</li>
</ul>

<h4>Phase 3: Mass Adoption and Accessibility</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Launch user-friendly mobile app for widespread participation in the network
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement intuitive interfaces for non-technical users to contribute and
    benefit from optimized AI models
  </li>
  <li>
    Fully integrate EdgeMaxxing with w.ai, making all optimized models instantly
    available and usable on the platform
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Long-term Vision</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Transform EdgeMaxxing into a cornerstone of decentralized AI, where:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any device, from smartphones to high-end GPUs, can contribute to and
        benefit from the network
      </li>
      <li>Optimized models power a new generation of AI-driven applications</li>
      <li>
        EdgeMaxxing becomes the go-to platform for rapid benchmarking and
        optimization of new AI models on diverse hardware
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Through each phase, we'll continuously refine our techniques, expand hardware
  support, and push the boundaries of AI optimization for edge computing.
