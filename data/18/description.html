<h2>
  Predicting future environmental variables within a decentralized framework
</h2>
<p>
  <b>Overview:</b> The Zeus Subnet leverages advanced AI models within the
  Bittensor network to forecast environmental data. This platform is engineered
  on a decentralized, incentive-driven framework to enhance trustworthiness and
  stimulate continuous technological advancement. The datasource for this subnet
  consists of ERA5 reanalysis data from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the
  European Union's Earth observation programme (Copernicus). This comprises the
  largest global environmental dataset to date, containing hourly measurements
  from 1940 until the present across a multitude of hundreds of variables.
  Validators can stream data from this data source in real-time, allowing miners
  to be queried on terrabytes of data.

  <b>Purpose:</b> Traditionally, environmental forecasting is achieved through
  physics-based numerical weather/environmental prediction (NWP). While this
  allows for very accurate predictions, it is also highly cost-ineffective,
  requiring large amounts of computing power for a single forecast. Furthermore,
  predictions are time expensive to obtain, since the simulation process of
  these NWP algorithms can take multiple hours to finish. Currently, there is a
  lot of ongoing research into the development of intelligent, data-driven
  algorithms for environmental prediction. Such algorithms can potentially be
  much faster, more accurate, at a fraction of the cost and carbon emissions.
  This subnet incentives the development of novel and groundbreaking
  architectures for enviromental data prediction. Through the continious
  evolution of this subnet, we are able to allow miners to tackle increasingly
  difficult problems over time.
