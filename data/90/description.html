<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  The Brain subnet is designed to create a decentralized prediction market
  verification system where:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Miners</strong> verify statements by determining if they are true or
    false with confidence intervals
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validators</strong> evaluate miners&#39; verification results for
    accuracy and proper methodology
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This creates an incentive mechanism where the most accurate and reliable
  verification miners receive a greater share of TAO emissions.
</p>

<p>The subnet consists of the following components:</p>
<h3 id="core-components">Core Components</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Protocol</strong>: Defines the communication protocol between miners
    and validators
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Miners</strong>: Verify statements using open-source methods and
    provide results
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validators</strong>: Evaluate miner results and distribute rewards
    based on accuracy
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Statement verification with confidence intervals</li>
  <li>Evidence-based verification methodology</li>
  <li>Cross-validation to prevent cheating</li>
  <li>Reward mechanism based on accuracy and evidence quality</li>
</ul>
