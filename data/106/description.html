<h2 id="what-is-lp-">What Is LP?</h2>
<p>
  LP is a dedicated Bittensor subnet (SN106) coordinating on-chain liquidity for
  Alpha tokens on Raydium. Instead of generic AMMs, LP introduces
  <strong>proof-of-provision</strong>: miners bridge TAO or Alpha to mint
  wTAO/wALPHA, deposit them (paired with TAO) into Raydium pools, then stake the
  resulting LP tokens in our Solana smart contract.
</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Bridge &amp; Mint:</strong> Miners lock native TAO/Alpha on
      Bittensor via the VoidAI Bridge and receive wrapped SPL tokens on Solana.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Provide Liquidity:</strong> They supply wTAO/wALPHA pairs to
      Raydium pools and receive LP tokens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Stake &amp; Validate:</strong> LP tokens are staked in a smart
      contract on Solana. Validators on SN106 samples both chains to confirm
      each deposit’s size and uptime, ensuring only genuine contributions earn
      rewards.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Reward Distribution:</strong> 41 % to liquidity providers
      (miners), 41 % to validators/stakers, and 18 % to the subnet owner
      (VoidAI).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="treasury-protocol-owned-liquidity">
  Treasury &amp; Protocol-Owned Liquidity
</h2>
<p>
  All fees—0.25 % Raydium trading fees, bridge fees, staking yields, and
  validator commissions—are funneled into the on-chain treasury on Solana. From
  there, funds are redeployed into wTAO/wALPHA pools as protocol-owned
  liquidity, deepening markets and earning ongoing fees. This creates a
  self-reinforcing cycle: revenue funds liquidity, liquidity boosts volume,
  volume generates more revenue.

<h2 id="governance-community">Governance &amp; Community</h2>
<p>LP token holders govern key aspects of the subnet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>New Pools:</strong> Vote to onboard additional Solana-native
      assets.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Treasury Deployment:</strong> Direct where treasury funds are
      deployed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All governance actions and treasury flows are recorded on-chain for complete
  transparency.
