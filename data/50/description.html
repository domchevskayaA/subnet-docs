<p>
  The main goal of the BittAudio is to establish a decentralized platform that
  incentivizes the creation, distribution and also monetization of AI audio
  content, such as Text-to-Music (TTM)
</p>
<p>
  Validators and miners work together to ensure high-quality outputs, fostering
  innovation and rewarding contributions in the audio domain. By introducing
  audio generation service such as Text-to-Music, this subnetwork expands the
  range of available service within the Bittensor ecosystem. This
  diversification enhances the utility and appeal of the Bittensor platform to a
  broader audience, including creators, influencers, developers, and end-users
  interested in audio content.
