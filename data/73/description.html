<p>
  Merit is a Bittensor subnet that rewards miners for their
  <strong>active participation across other Bittensor subnets</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Validators evaluate <strong>registered hotkeys</strong> based on their
  cross-subnet activity and uptime, assigning dynamic weights according to a
  calculated <strong>Bittensor Miner Participation Score (BMPS)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Merit is designed to promote real work, broad contribution, and fair
  validation.
