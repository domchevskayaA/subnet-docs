<h2>LogicNet: Open-Source AI for Complex Mathematics and Data Analysis</h2>

<p>
  Our goal is to develop an open-source AI model capable of complex mathematics
  and detailed data analysis, enhanced by incentivized human feedback for
  continuous improvement.
</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>ðŸš€ Advanced Computational Network:</strong> Incentivizing miners to
    enhance computational resources for complex AI/ML tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ðŸ“ˆ Performance Commitment:</strong> Miners commit to a category and
    volume per epoch.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ðŸ’° Incentive Mechanism:</strong>
    <p>
      reward = (0.6 * accuracy_score) + (0.4 * reasoning_score) - 0.1 *
      time_penalty
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>accuracy_score is based on the correctness of the result.</li>
      <li>
        reasoning_score measures the similarity between the generated text and
        reference data.
      </li>
      <li>time_score is derived from the time taken to generate the result.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ðŸŒŸ Continuous Improvement:</strong> Adding more math problem sets
    and categories.
  </li>
</ul>
