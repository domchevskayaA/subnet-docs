  NextPlace: The real estate valuation subnet on Bittensor. Predict property
  sales for accurate valuations.
</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Nextplace AI is decentralizing intelligence around housing markets. In a space
  controlled by monopolies and gatekeepers, Nexplace seeks to provide a
  democratized network to evaluate home prices for everybody.
</p>
<h3>AI Powered Analysis</h3>
<p>
  We're sourcing data from the hottest housing markets in the USA. We're pulling
  data from New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and many, many more. Our subnet
  Miners use AI models to predict sale price and sale date on millions of houses
  per day and we score their accuracy, once a home sells.

<h3>Nextplace Roadmap</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Expand Markets</h4>
    <p>
      Nexplace will progressively add more markets, challenging miners to
      develop better and more generalizable models. This expansion will provide
      increased value to Nextplace consumers by offering insights into a wider
      range of housing markets.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Visualize Sales-to-Listing Data</h4>
    <p>
      The Nexplace website will evolve into a central hub for visualizing
      different markets, providing valuable information to home buyers and
      sellers. The initial phase will focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Displaying the difference between home prices and actual sales</li>
      <li>Showcasing top miners' predictions for current listings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Implement "Price My Home" Feature</h4>
    <p>
      Nextplace will introduce a feature allowing users to obtain property value
      estimates through the website. This process will involve:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Forwarding user requests to top-performing miners</li>
      <li>
        Generating estimates for users' homes or properties they're interested
        in purchasing
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing buyers and sellers with a deeper understanding of their
        transactions and the true value of homes
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
