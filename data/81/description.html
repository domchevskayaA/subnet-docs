  Great Security Starts With Great Coverage
</h2>
<p>
  Patrol&#39;s mission started after the Bittensor summer attacks where we saw
  $20M+ stolen from TAO holders, members of our Bittensor community.
</p>
<p>
  Our mission, simply put, is to secure crypto funds and provide all holders
  peace of mind, wherever they are.
</p>
<p>
  Patrol is our first step in harnessing Bittensor to collect large volumes of
  live data which in later stages will be analyzed and used to prevent hacks.

  In Patrol, miners and validators work together to intelligently collect large
  volumes of data from various data sources. It lays the foundation for advanced
  security intelligence by creating a knowledge graph that maps relationships
  and behaviours, aiding in investigations, threat detection, and risk
  assessment.
</p>
<p>
  The first data source weâ€™re covering is in our own backyard: The Bittensor
  chain. But this is just the beginning as we plan to expand to many other
  chains as well as other types of data sources like social media, code repos,
  phishing websites, and more. Ultimately, our goal over time is to build a
  unified graph of relationships for every crypto wallet that shows all its
  relationships.

  One of the key lessons from the Bittensor summer attacks is that tracing
  footprints after the fact takes A LOT of time and is VERY costly. And when it
  comes to crypto theft investigation, time is of the essence. The longer it is
  from time of attack the less likely one is to recover funds.
</p>
<p>
  The footprint graph that Patrol creates is a must-have for any security team,
  investigator and platform developing and solving crypto security.

<p>
  Soon after Patrol launches we plan to provide a Public API for developers
  interested in consuming the data collected by the Patrol subnet.
