<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
  In 2024, the advertising industry is expected to lose over $100 billion due to
  ad fraud and ineffective strategies. Ad fraud, including fake clicks and bot
  traffic, inflates engagement metrics and wastes significant ad spend.
  Traditional models, like pay-per-click and pay-per-impression, often fail to
  deliver real value, as they don't directly correlate with actual sales,
  leading to wasted budgets and reduced trust. The rise of AI is expected to
  significantly increase the potential for ad fraud over the next five years by
  20-30%. This increase could lead to global losses exceeding $150 billion
  annually by 2028, as fraudsters use AI to generate more convincing fake
  clicks, impressions, and user interactions.

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>
  BitAds addresses these challenges by focusing on actual sales rather than
  clicks or impressions. With its newly implemented Conversion Tracking system
  on Bittensor Subnet 16, BitAds ensures advertisers only pay for successful
  sales, reducing fraud and guaranteeing that every dollar spent leads to real
  outcomes. Miners earn TAO rewards based on the sales they generate, not just
  traffic, driving higher-quality advertising.
