<p>
  HashTensor is a decentralized Bittensor subnet designed to track and validate
  mining activity across multiple proof-of-work blockchains. By introducing a
  model called Proof of Effective Work (PoEW), the system rewards miners not
  just for raw hashrate, but for performance, uptime, and reliability, allowing
  them to earn Alpha tokens based on their actual contribution.

<p>
  HashTensor captures the value of mining by redirecting hashrate into a
  performance-driven reward model that fuels Alpha’s growth through buybacks and
  token burns.
</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Miners contribute hashrate to supported PoW networks (starting with Kaspa).
  </li>
  <li>
    Initially, All mined KAS is initially collected by the HashTensor wallet.
  </li>
  <li>
    That KAS is converted into TAO, then used to buy back Subnet 16 Alpha tokens
    from the open market.
  </li>
  <li>
    A portion of each buyback is permanently burned to reduce total supply and
    reinforce Alpha&#39;s deflationary nature.
  </li>
  <li>
    Currently, 5% of each buyback is burned. Over time, this will scale up to
    90% as part of our phased fee reduction model.
  </li>
  <li>
    Miner fees will gradually decrease from 100% to 10%, enabling dual rewards
    while boosting Alpha’s value through aggressive buybacks and burns.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This model transforms raw hashrate into verifiable economic output, rewarding
  miners while systematically increasing the scarcity and value of Alpha over
  time.
