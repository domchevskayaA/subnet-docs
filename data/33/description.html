  ReadyAI is an open-source initiative aimed at provide a low-cost
  resource-minimal data structuring and semantic tagging pipeline for any
  individual or business. AI runs on Structured Data. ReadyAI is a low-cost,
  structured data pipeline to turn your raw data into structured data for your
  vector databases and AI applications.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Raw Data in, structured AI Ready Data out</li>
  <li>
    Fractal data mining allows miners to process a wide variety of data sources
    and create tagged, structured data for the end user's specific needs
  </li>
  <li>
    Validators establish a ground truth by tagging the data in full, create data
    windows for fractal mining, and score miner submissions
  </li>
  <li>
    Scoring is based on a cosine distance calculation between the miner's window
    tagged output and the validator's ground truth tagged output
  </li>
  <li>
    ReadyAI has created a low-cost structured data pipeline capitalizing on two
    key innovations:
    <ol>
      <li>LLMs are now more accurate and cheaper than human annotators</li>
      <li>
        Distributed compute vs. distributed workers make this infinitely
        scalable
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Incentivized mining and validation system for data contribution and
    integrity
  </li>
</ul>
