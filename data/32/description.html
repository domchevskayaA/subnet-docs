<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Our subnet incentivizes the development of distributed solutions aimed at
  identifying LLM-generated content.
</p>

<p>
  Given the rapid growth of LLM-generated text, such as ChatGPT's output of 100
  billion words daily compared to humans' 100 trillion, we believe that the
  ability to accurately determine AI-generated text will become increasingly
  necessary.
</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
  With the recent surge in LLMs appeared many cases where we do actually want to
  recognize where this text was generated by AI or written by human. Let's
  explore some scenarios to highlight the potential and significance of LLM
  detection.
</p>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>For ML-engineers:</strong> Whether you're sourcing training data,
    developing a foundational LLM, or fine tuning on your own data, you need to
    ensure generative text does not make it into your training set. We can help.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>For teachers:</strong> While tools like ChatGPT offer numerous
    benefits for the educational sector, they also present opportunities for
    students to cheat on assignments and exams. Therefore, it is crucial to
    differentiate between responses authored by genuine students and those
    generated by LLMs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>For bloggers:</strong> Recently many bloggers faced with a lot of
    ai-generated comments in their social networks. These comments are not
    really meaningful but attract the attention of their audience and promote
    unrelated products. With our subnet, you can easily identify which comments
    are ai-generated and automatically ban them.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Applications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>For writers:</strong> By utilizing an LLM detection system, writers
    can assess their text segment by segment to identify sections that appear
    machine-generated. This enables them to refine these areas to enhance the
    overall human-like quality of their writing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>For recruiting:</strong> Have you also noticed receiving far more
    applications with lower candidate quality? AI has enabled people to spam
    hiring teams with artificially written cover letters and assessments. We
    help you find the candidates who care about your mission and your quality
    standards.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>For cyber security:</strong> Scammers can leverage LLMs to quickly
    and easily create realistic and personalized phishing emails. We can help
    you determine the provenance of any document or email you're reviewing.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As you can see there are a lot of areas where AI detection can be very
  helpful. We believe that creating llm-detection subnet not only provides a
  useful tool at a good price for people to use, but also encourages competition
  to make better and smarter ways to spot AI-generated content.
