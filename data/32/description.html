<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>It&#39;s AI is an ai-detector tool, which helps people to identify whether the text was human-written or ai-generated. In addition to just classifying texts, It&#39;s AI also provides a deep scan functionality, which shows probabilities of AI for each sentence in the text.</p>
<p>While ChatGpt alone has more than 1.8 billion monthly visits, we believe that the ability to accurately determine AI-generated text is really important and will become even more demanded in the future.</p>

<h2 id="key-highlights">Key Highlights</h2>
<p>Here is a key highlights of It&#39;s AI:</p>
<p>1) Most accurate ai-detector in the world according to RAID benchmark (ACL paper 2024)</p>
<p>2) More than just a subnet. Recently we&#39;ve opened an ITSAI TECHNOLOGIES - FZCO, our legal entity in Dubai, which will help us to grow and process payments outside of bittensor.</p>
<p>3) Constantly improving. We&#39;ve already developed website, web app, chrome extension, API, britishiser and aren&#39;t going to stop on them. Try It&#39;s AI by yourself at <a href="https://its-ai.org">https://its-ai.org</a>.</p>
<p>4) High market potential. More than 3 billion dollars in market size in just English-speaking countries and we&#39;re going right for it. The real-world demand is evident, as demonstrated by our competitors: GptZero (50m$ valuation), CopyLeaks (4m$ last year revenue), ZeroGpt (10m monthly visits) and others.</p>
<p>5) Incentive mechanism. Time and benchmarks proven validation process that makes miners work in the right direction. Thanks to it we&#39;ve become a new state-of-the-art solution on all three considered academia-known benchmarks.</p>
