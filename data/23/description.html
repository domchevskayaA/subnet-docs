  NicheImage is a decentralized network that utilizes the Bittensor protocol to
  enable distributed image generation. This document serves as a guide for
  setting up and participating in the network, targeting both validators and
  miners. It includes essential information on project setup, operation, and
  contribution.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Decentralized Image Generation Network:</strong> Incentivizing
    miners to scale up their computational resources, allowing for up to
    thousands of generations per minute with sufficient GPU resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Volume Commitment:</strong> Miners commit to a model type and
    generation volume.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fixed And Open Category:</strong> Miners run fixed model list or
    their own choice for tailored domain.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Incentivized Volume Rewarding Mechanism:</strong>
    <p>
      New reward is calculated based on category score, time penalty, and volume
      scale.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Introducing new models and features
    based on usage demand.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Earn as a Validator:</strong> Validators can earn money by sharing
    their request capacity with miners.
  </li>
</ul>
