<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Nuance is a revolutionary subnet project aimed at transforming the media
  landscape by incentivizing users on X to promote factual and nuanced opinions.
</p>
<p>
  Our vision is to create a decentralized swarm that assist humans in
  understanding contemporary issues in a fair and transparent manner.
</p>
<h2 id="incentive-mechanism">Incentive Mechanism</h2>
<p>
  In this subnet, miners are rewarded for contributing factual and nuanced posts
  and comments. The reward system is designed to encourage high-quality content
  by basing rewards on the engagement received from verified accounts.
  Here&#39;s how it works:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Objective</strong>: To challenge media giants by fostering a
    community that values factual and nuanced discourse.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mechanism</strong>: Miners are incentivized to create content that
    is both factual and nuanced. Their rewards are determined by the level of
    engagement their content receives from verified users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Engagement</strong>: The focus is on interactions such as replies,
    which are currently easier to track on X, but the system is designed to be
    adaptable to other social platforms in the future.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The validator plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and quality of
  the content within the subnet. The main logic loop of the validator involves
  several steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Account Verification</strong>: Miners commit their X account
    username and verification post ID on-chain. Validators verify miners by
    checking that the verification post quotes the Nuance announcement post and
    contains the miner&#39;s hotkey.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Content Discovery</strong>: Validators query on-chain commits to
    retrieve miners&#39; X accounts. They then discover new posts made by
    miners, filtering them through Large Language Models (LLM) to ensure the
    content is nuanced and relevant to specific subjects, such as bittensor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interaction Analysis</strong>: Validators identify interactions with
    miners&#39; posts, filtering them for positivity and ensuring they originate
    from a list of verified users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scoring</strong>: Interactions are scored based on the number of
    followers the interacting user has, with higher scores for more influential
    users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Score Calculation</strong>: Miners&#39; scores are calculated using
    an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to ensure a fair and dynamic reward
    system.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  By focusing on these elements, Nuance aims to create a sustainable and
  impactful media ecosystem that rewards quality and integrity.
