  <strong>SN13</strong> is Bittensor's data scraping and storage subnet.
  Developing state-of-the-art intelligence depends disproportionately on the
  underlying datasets, and SN13 provides the Bittensor ecosystem with diverse,
  high-quality datasets from a wide array of sources.

<h2>How SN13 Delivers Data at Scale</h2>

<h3>1. Built from the Ground Up</h3>
<p>
  SN13 is a bespoke, Bittensor-native solution to data collection and storage:
  designed by Bittensor users, for Bittensor users.
</p>

<h3>2. Integrated for Better Performance</h3>
<p>
  Its integration with the ecosystem allows other Subnets to easily access and
  deploy vast amounts of disparate data, driving efficiency.
</p>

<h3>3. Unlocking New Use Cases</h3>
<p>
  The data collected by this subnet is the very fuel that we need to build the
  next generation of AI. We're committed to making the very best version of this
  subnet for miners, validators and end users.
