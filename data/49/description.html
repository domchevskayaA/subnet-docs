  <strong>BitTranslate</strong> is a Subnet that rewards high-quality
  translations. Validators produce unique text using a multilingual text
  generation model. The text is then sent to Miners which apply a text-to-text
  model to produce a translation. The validator then evaluates the outputted
  translations using two Reward Models that are based on the methods from
  academic papers.
</p>

<p>
  The subnet has been designed to be able to accommodate numerous translation
  pairs.
