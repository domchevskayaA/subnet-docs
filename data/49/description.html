<h2 id="subnet-purpose-and-objectives">Subnet Purpose and Objectives</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Polaris</strong> is a Bittensor subnet designed as a decentralized GPU
  compute marketplace and management layer. Its primary goal is to
  <strong
    >connect miners who have spare GPU resources with the Bittensor
    network</strong
  >, enabling those GPUs to be used for AI tasks and other compute-intensive
  workloads in a trustless environment.
</p>
<p>
  Polaris&#39;s <strong>mission</strong> is to be
  <em>&quot;the best place on this planet to list your GPUs,&quot;</em>
  simplifying how operators join the Bittensor compute network. To achieve this,
  Polaris offers user-friendly tools to register and manage compute nodes across
  distributed environments.
</p>
<p>Key objectives of the Polaris subnet include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Decentralized Compute Market:</strong> Create a trustless
    marketplace for GPU compute resources
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Robust Validation:</strong> Ensure reliable and accurate performance
    measurement
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ease of Use and Management:</strong> Provide intuitive tools for
    node operators
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Seamless Bittensor Integration:</strong> Maintain compatibility with
    the Bittensor ecosystem
  </li>
</ul>
