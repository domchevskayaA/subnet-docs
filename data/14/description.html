<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
  The current fraud detection landscape, particularly in centralized systems,
  poses significant challenges:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Users face data breaches and privacy issues, leading to a lack of trust in
    online transactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Centralized fraud detection systems are prone to inefficiencies and high
    operational costs, making them less accessible for smaller organizations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cryptocurrency transactions are particularly vulnerable, with frequent
    hacking attempts targeting wallets and network vulnerabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes it difficult to implement
    traditional fraud detection methods, leading to substantial financial losses
    and compromised network integrity.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>

  to create a decentralized and incentivized fraud detection environment for
  crypto transactions. By distributing control and data across a decentralized
