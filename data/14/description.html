  TAO Hash is a Bittensor Subnet for incentivizing and decentralizing the
  production of proof-of-work (PoW) mining hashrate, rental and exchange.
  Validators receive hashrate from miners in exchange for issuing weights, while
  miners contribute hashrate and speculate on hashrate, hashprice and Alpha
  emissions. Effectively, Alpha is swapped for BTC hashrate automatically.

  Although the initial implementation primarily supports Bitcoin mining via
  Braiins Pool, the architecture is designed to be extensible to other mineable
  projects with similar capabilities for verifying miner performance presicely
  and efficiently.
