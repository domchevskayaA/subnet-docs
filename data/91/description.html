<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>
  Tensorprox introduces a novel approach to
  <strong>DDoS protection</strong> with a distributed architecture and an
  innovative incentive mechanism powered by the
  <strong>Bittensor Network</strong>. The validation process leverages
  <strong>synthetic traffic generation</strong>, alternating between normal and
  malicious network behaviors to simulate realistic attack scenarios. This
  project aims to evolve into a <strong>global cybersecurity solution</strong>,
  tackling the most complex security challenges.

<p>
  Tensorprox redefines distributed DDoS mitigation by simulating complex network
  environments and evaluating miner performance in high-stress scenarios. The
  subnet operates on a unique distributed network architecture where:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Validators</strong> challenge miners by simulating real-world DDoS
    scenarios
  </li>
  <li><strong>Miners</strong> provide DDoS protection services</li>
  <li>
    Performance is evaluated through comprehensive
    <strong>traffic analysis</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It employs a novel architectural design to build a robust and adaptable
  mitigation system. This design strategically positions key components to
  ensure comprehensive protection of the target server, referred to as the
  &quot;King&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>King</strong>: It represents the target server requiring protection.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Traffic generators</strong>: These machines (tgens) generate a blend
  of traffic, dynamically configured per round to simulate varying network
  conditions, including DDoS spikes and legitimate traffic flows.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Moat</strong>: It is run by miners and acts as a routing firewall. The
  Moat leverages Advanced Forwarding eXpress Data Path (AF_XDP) for
  high-performance packet processing.
</p>
<p>
  The system works by positioning the Moat strategically between the traffic
  generators and the King. All traffic must pass through the Moat, which
  analyzes and filters it based on pre-defined rules and dynamically learned
  patterns.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: For scalability reasons, access to the traffic
  generator and King machines must be provided by the miner to the validator via
  SSH connections.

  Scalable and Balanced Network Growth
</h1>
<p>
  Tensorprox enables progressive scalability through competitive bandwidth
  handling, allowing miners to gradually increase the number of tgen machines
  over time. This design incentivizes miners to process higher volumes of
  network traffic (see Reward Mechanism), promoting scale and performance. To
  prevent abuse and ensure quality, the multi-factor reward function balances
  throughput with traffic filtering accuracy and latency efficiency. Miners must
  maintain a high mitigation ratio and low response times to benefit from
  additional tgen deployments, fostering a natural equilibrium between scale and
  effectiveness.
