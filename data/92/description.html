<h2>Code is the law. But who wrote the code?</h2>

<p>
  Code is the law. But who wrote the code? And more importantly — how good is
  it? When the code handles important things like money, the most important
  thing becomes — how secure is it?
</p>

<p>
  In 10+ years of smart contracts we've seen numerous hacks and billions of
  dollars stolen. That means code is not always secure, and should not be the
  law until proven it can be secure. Auditing of smart contracts is a sizable
  business, but it moves at the snail speed, nothing like the breakneck
  competitive DeFi markets. Another way, used to improve security is automated
  tests, which have the same mismatch — it takes a bunch of time to make them,
  and every time a change or new feature is introduced — new tests are needed.
  Both approaches also require investments, sometimes very significant ones.

<h3>The Promise of AI in Smart Contract Auditing</h3>

<p>
  As LLMs are conquering the world, developers started to use them to check
  vulnerabilities in smart contracts. For a good reason — they are getting
  better at it every day. This approach holds a great promise, where the code
  can be checked quickly and cheaply. However, just like usage of AI for most
  other cases, this requires expertise — how to design prompts, how to ensure
  the LLM is good at discovering issues, how to discover hallucinations or
  simply how to distinguish irrelevant issues for a particular contract, etc.
  LLMs are infrastructure, and to use their capabilities for improvements in the
  smart contract code solutions on top of them are needed.
</p>

<p>
  Experienced Auditors have discovered this and have started to use AI as a tool
  to assist their experienced staff in doing their work faster and cheaper. Some
  are creating solutions.
</p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>

<p>
  The mission of ReinforcedAI's Solidity Audit Subnet Pi is to accelerate this
  process by combining knowledge and expertise of such teams. Aligning
  decentralized sources of expertise towards competition and benchmarking
  against peers is the most effective mechanism to accomplish that mission.
  Bittensor's architecture and incentive mechanisms are the perfect way to
  organize the market for that knowledge and expertise — there are clear
  incentives to join and competitive mechanisms that motivate improvements,
  which is exactly what is needed to create the most innovative solutions.
</p>

<h3>Fair Process and Competition</h3>

<p>
  Like for any markets, organizing the fair process is the crucial ingredient
  for success. Like for any market, that job is never ending — people will
  compete and will be stretching the rules, so ongoing monitoring and actions
  are necessary to have the process stay fair. We begin with a structure and
  setup that we believe are good to start from. Setting up a miner that works is
  easy — just take the code from the repo and see the instructions. However,
  that miner will not be competitive. Teams that want to mine this need to know
  Solidity and it's vulnerabilities very well, and come up with innovative ways
  to make their miner valuable to the Subnet.
</p>

<p>
  We've already attracted several such teams that have raised the bar of value
  added. Investment and knowledge will be needed to get into the game and stay
  there. We have started to address some of the other known issues with the
  Bittensor incentive mechanism. While the community was focused on solving the
  problem of copying weights and we learned from its efforts, we paid particular
  attention to another issue — teams tend to make one miner work, and then
  multiply it without doing additional work in their copies, simply copying the
  results of Validator tasks from one of their miners that does the work.
</p>

<h3>Innovative Solutions</h3>

<p>
  We created a solution to this problem with a Proof of Work mechanism using
  NFTs as certificates of audit for each miner. During years of our work on
  advanced use cases for NFTs as a technology we found this one being the
  perfect match. The fact that the solution we created serves as an example of
  the interoperability and power of Substrate tech (NFTs are minted on
  Polkadot's Unique.Network parachain) is a nice plus for us.
</p>

<h3>Our Journey Forward</h3>

<p>
  As we get to the step by step procedure of the SN launch we are looking
  forward to engaging deeper with the Bittensor ecosystem. We came after working
  on Polkadot for 6 years, and we came with gifts — we created the "Beadecker"
  CI tool used widely in Bittensor, and have provided it for free. We hope to
  make long lasting relationships, and are looking forward to this journey.
</p>

<p>
  One last note — we are a team that chooses what it does carefully, for the
  long term. Our vision for what solutions will be built on top of the SN is
  only beginning to form, and will take a while. We are on the cutting edge of
  the tech, which means there's no road ahead unless we make it. We will make it
  step by step and will pivot at every corner. We will be experimenting with
  GTMs and you should expect a number of them to fail, until we find one that
  works. This is the only way to build a successful high tech start up.
