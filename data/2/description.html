  Omron is the next stage in building cryptographically verified efficient and
  intelligent capital networks. By leveraging cryptographically verified
  trustless protocol and AI models to analyze data, Omron can direct liquidity
  across various AVS for optimal yields. Using an innovative Proof-of-Inference
  mechanism and specially trained Staking and Restaking Strategy AI models,
  Omron has developed a framework that allows the processing of mass AVS data,
  and actioning on that data through AI with verifiable computational integrity.
  Utilizing the scaleable analytical capacity of AI, Omron is capable of
  reviewing and evaluating the ever growing number of available AVS options.
  This capacity is to increase over time with an expanding set of AI models
  capable of optimizing AVS derived yields across multiple ecosystems. Omronâ€™s
  computational integrity is reinforced through the use of a Proof-of-Inference
  mechanism. A protocol which leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs to verify proper
  operation of AI models and their resulting functions. Providing not only peace
  of mind and protection from malicious or malfunctioning AI, but also providing
  the ability for LRT systems (such as Renzo, ether.fi, and EigenLayer) to
  automatically accept output results at face value due to this improved
  security, adding a new level of efficiency. With infinitely scalable
  processing capacity and verifiable computational integrity of AI, Omron is
  building the next stage in secure and automated Liquid Staking.
