  The protein folding subnet is Bittensorsâ€™ first venture into academic use
  cases, built and maintained by Macrocosmos AI. While the current subnet
  landscape consists of mainly AI and web-scraping protocols, we believe that it
  is important to highlight to the world how Bittensor is flexible enough to
  solve almost any problem. This subnet is designed to produce valuable academic
  research in Bittensor. Researchers and universities can use this subnet to
  solve almost any protein, on demand, for free. It is our hope that this subnet
  will empower researchers to conduct world-class research and publish in top
  journals while demonstrating that decentralized systems are an economic and
  efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

<h2>What is Protein Folding?</h2>
<p>
  Proteins are the molecular machines of biochemistry, performing crucial
  functions in living organisms. They are made from long chains of amino acids,
  with the sequence encoded in DNA. However, for a protein to function properly,
  it must fold into a specific 3D structure.
</p>
<p>
  Protein folding is the process by which a 2D chain of amino acids transforms
  into a stable, 3D shape. This folding process occurs naturally, resulting in a
  structure with lower free energy than the initial string. The phrase "form
  defines function" is key in biochemistry, highlighting the importance of
  understanding and simulating this process to determine both the structure and
  function of proteins.

<h2>Why is Folding a Good Subnet Idea?</h2>
<p>
  An ideal incentive mechanism for a subnet should create an asymmetric workload
  between validators and miners. Protein folding fits this model well:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Miners must perform substantial computational work to simulate protein
    folding, which is difficult to circumvent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Validators can objectively score and reward miners' work from a privileged
    position, ensuring fairness and robustness against adversarial behavior.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Moreover, protein folding is a research topic of immense value, with research
  groups worldwide dedicating their efforts to solving various aspects of this
  problem. By providing a scalable solution through Bittensor, this subnet
  offers a powerful tool for the global scientific community to tackle this
  complex challenge collectively.
