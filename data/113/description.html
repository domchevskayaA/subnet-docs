  A Privacy Preserving TAO Mixer on Bittensor
</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Taonado</strong> is a zero knowledge (ZK) based token mixer for the
  Bittensor ($TAO) ecosystem, inspired by the privacy principles of Tornado
  Cash. It enables users to deposit and withdraw TAO tokens with complete
  anonymity, severing the onchain link between sender and receiver addresses.
  Built to align with Bittensor&#39;s incentivized network, Taonado rewards
  participants for contributing to network privacy and security.
