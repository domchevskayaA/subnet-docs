<h2>Neural Condense Subnet</h2>

<p>
  The subnet offers an additional benefit regarding privacy. If users or
  companies utilize a subnet to transform their context into condensed tokens
  before sending them to other LLM services, this approach can help prevent
  context leaks. The transformation increases the computational complexity,
  making it more difficult for unauthorized entities to extract the original
  context.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Seamless Integration</b> - Effortlessly integrates with LLM inference
    engines, such as transformers ðŸ¤—, vllm.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Token Compression</b> - The subnet API compresses long sequences of
    natural language tokens into soft tokens.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Decentralized Network</b> - The subnet is a decentralized network that
    allows miners to contribute to the compression process.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Tiered System</b> - The subnet has a tiered system, with a research tier
    for experimentation and an inference tier for production-scale use.
    Incentive distribution is split for each tier.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Benchmarking and Validation</b> - The subnet owner defines synthetic
    metrics to benchmark minersâ€™ performance, ensuring quality and efficiency.
  </li>
</ul>
