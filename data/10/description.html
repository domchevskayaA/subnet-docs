  <strong>Sturdy Subnet</strong> is a Bittensor subnetwork that enables the
  creation of decentralized, autonomous yield optimizers. A yield optimizer is a
  smart contract that seeks to provide users with the best possible yields by
  depositing assets to a variety of strategies. On the Sturdy Subnet, every
  yield optimizer has a fixed set of strategies (or 'pools') that it can deposit
  to. In turn, each pool has its own interest rate curve, described in more
  detail below. The goal for each miner is to create an algorithm that computes
  the allocation of assets among pools that results in the highest yield
  possible. Validators then evaluate miners based on how much yield their
  allocation produces. The outputs of the subnet will be used by third-party
  applications to move real assets on the Ethereum network. The first
  application using the Sturdy Subnet is the Sturdy protocol, with more to come.
