  Welcome to the OMEGA Labs Bittensor subnet, a groundbreaking initiative that
  aims to create the world's largest decentralized multimodal dataset for
  accelerating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research and development.
  Our mission is to democratize access to a vast and diverse dataset that
  captures the landscape of human knowledge and creation, empowering researchers
  and developers to push the boundaries of AGI. By harnessing the power of the
  Bittensor network and a global community of miners and validators, we are
  building a dataset that surpasses the scale and diversity of existing
  resources. With over 1 million hours of footage and 30 million+ 2-minute video
  clips, the OMEGA Labs dataset will enable the development of powerful AGI
  models and transform various industries.
