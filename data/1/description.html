  <strong>Macrocosmos Subnet</strong> is producing agentic workflows in
  conjunction with LLMs that surpass the capabilities of proprietary models at
  specific tasks, demonstrating that decentralized systems are a viable path
  towards creating truly open SOTA AI models.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Producing highly specialized, targeted intelligence:</strong> SN1
    turns raw intelligence into a digital commodity for users to access. Through
    chat interfaces, APIs, and other mechanisms, SN1 enables users and
    businesses to interact with the intelligent hivemind. At present, SN1
    already powers four different user-facing products.

  <li>
    <strong
      >Expanding the incentive landscape to deliver human-like
      interactions:</strong
    >
    Building on its legacy as the flagship subnet of the protocol, SN1 continues
    to push the boundaries of mechanism design. We're now integrating a
    secondary layer of organic queries into the validation process, to further
    incentivize miners to avoid over-fitting to the rigidity of synthetic
    prompts and deliver human responses to human queries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Unlocking the potential of subnets across Bittensor:</strong> SN1 is
    at the heart of the Macrocosmos ecosystem, building upon SN9's pre-training
    and SN37's Fine-tuning through synthetic data generation. Through data
    annotation and sentiment analysis, it allows Subnet 13's data universe to
    serve user needs, forming the core of an intelligence pipeline.

</ul>
