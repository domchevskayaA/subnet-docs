<p>
  Text-to-Speech (TTS) models serve as the backbone for a wide range of
  applications, from virtual assistants to audiobooks. MyShell pioneers this
  field by open-sourcing the best TTS models, OpenVoice and MeloTTS. We believe
  that open-source TTS models are essential for the future of AI and are
  committed to building a decentralized ecosystem to support their development.
  Yet, the TTS landscape is still in its infancy. In this subnet, we aim to
  gather the wisdom of the whole open-source community to create the best
  open-source TTS models.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>
  The MyShell-TTS Subnet is currently in Phase 2 of development. In this phase,
  we are utilizing the AniSpeech dataset as our source of speaker data. We
  randomly select one speaker from the dataset, and the goal is to build a TTS
  model that can perfectly mimic this speaker's voice. This approach allows us
  to increase our coverage of speakers and scenarios.
</p>

<p>For those interested in participating or evaluating our progress:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Audio samples from the selected speaker and the text used for evaluation can
    be found in the `tts_rater` folder of our repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    Options to download and preprocess the dataset for training are available in
    the `preprocess` folder.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As we progress through this phase, we aim to expand our capabilities to cover
  more speakers and languages, paving the way for the development of fast-clone
  models in future phases.

  <h3>Phase 1: Initial release</h3>
  <p>
    Initial release of the subnet, including miner and validator functionality.
    This phase aim to build a comprehensive pipeline for TTS model training and
    evaluation. We will begin with a fixed speaker.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="roadmap-phase">
  <h3>Phase 2: Increased coverage</h3>
  <p>
    Increase the coverage of speaker and conversation pool. We will recurrently
    update the speaker and language to cover more scenarios.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="roadmap-phase">
  <h3>Phase 3: Fast-clone models</h3>
  <p>
    More generally, we can have fast-clone models that can be adapted to new
    speakers with a small amount of data, e.g., OpenVoice. We will move to
    fast-clone models in this phase.
