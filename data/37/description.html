<h2>SN37: Bittensor's New Subnet for Fine-Tuning</h2>

<p>
  Fine-tuning delivers the 'final mile' of AI model development, playing a
  critical role in whether or not an AI application actually meets the needs of
  its users.
</p>

<h3>Enhancing Performance from the Start</h3>
<p>
  Our core improvements will refine the codebase, removing inefficiencies and
  strengthening the subnet's design to increase competitiveness. We're also
  improving front-end experience by designing and launching a real-time
  leaderboard.
</p>

<h3>Driving Continuous Improvement as Standard</h3>
<p>
  We'll also harden the incentive structure, by deploying incentive structures
  that prohibit miners from deploying models resistant to further improvements.
  This ensures all miners can use the leading model as a basis for further
  training, helping to maintain continuous improvement.
</p>

<h3>Deeper Integration for Bittensor</h3>
<p>
  By layering through SN1's inference, SN9's pretraining, and SN13's data
  scraping, we can develop a feedback loop where data is sourced, refined,
  trained, and shared entirely within the Bittensor ecosystem. This can unlock
  entirely new use cases for the whole community.
