<p>
  Vidaio&#39;s mission is to democratise video enhancement through
  decentralisation, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology.
  Leveraging the Bittensor ecosystem, Vidaio provides creators, businesses, and
  developers with scalable, affordable, and high-quality video upscaling
  solutions, while ensuring full ownership and control over their content.

<h3 id="2-1-overview">2.1 Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Miners</strong>: Handle video upscaling tasks and optimise models to
    ensure high-quality outputs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validators</strong>: Assess miner performance using predefined
    metrics to maintain network integrity.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-2-miners">2.2 Miners</h3>
<p>
  Miners enhance video quality using AI-driven upscaling techniques. They can:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Optimise open-source models or develop proprietary ones for superior
    results.
  </li>
  <li>Handle video upscaling requests from validators and end-users.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-3-validators">2.3 Validators</h3>
<p>
  Validators ensure miners deliver consistent, high-quality results by
  evaluating performance through synthetic and organic queries.

<h4 id="2-4-1-synthetic-query">2.4.1 Synthetic Query</h4>
<p>Validators benchmark miner performance using controlled datasets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Downscale a high-resolution video to low-resolution.</li>
  <li><p>Miners upscale the low-resolution video back to high.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>Validators assess the upscaled output using metrics VMAF and PieAPP.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-4-2-organic-query">2.4.2 Organic Query</h4>
<p>Real-world video data uploaded by users is processed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Videos are chunked and queued for miners.</li>
  <li>Miners process and upscale the chunks.</li>
  <li>Results are aggregated and delivered back to users.</li>
</ul>
