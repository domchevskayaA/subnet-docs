<h2>What Is Bettensor?</h2>
<p>
  Bettensor is a sports prediction subnet. The goal of Bettensor is to provide a
  platform for sports fans to predict the outcomes of their favorite sporting
  events, and ML/AI researchers to develop new models and strategies to
  benchmark against good, old fashioned human intelligence and intuition.
</p>

<p>
  Mining on this subnet is simple. In this Beta release, miners receive upcoming
  games and odds, submit predictions as a simulated wager, and are rewarded for
  correct predictions upon game conclusion. Compute requirements are minimal for
  those choosing the human intelligence method - all you need is to consistently
  submit predictions for upcoming games.
</p>

<h2>Incentive Mechanism and Scoring</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Miners get a simulated daily balance of $1000 which is reset daily at 00:00
    UTC.
  </li>
  <li>
    Miners can select games to predict on by placing a simulated moneyline
    wager.
  </li>
  <li>
    Odds for the wager are updated frequently from sportsbook APIs, and recorded
    by the validator upon submission of a prediction.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a game concludes, the outcome of the simulated wager is calculated with
    the Odds that were recorded on submission. The miner, if they won, then
    receives an "earnings balance" equal to the simulated wager amount
    multiplied by the Odds of their prediction at time of submission.
  </li>
  <li>Losses don't count against the earnings balance. Only wins affect it.</li>
  <li>
    Validators score miners on their earnings history. There is an exponential
    decay algorithm used to incentivize new predictions; old predictions
    decrease in value over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The top 50% of miners receive 90% of emissions. In the future, a few hundred
    predictions will be required to give a sufficient sample size, but that is
    not yet implemented.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This design incentivizes the best miners to provide their greatest alpha and
  be rewarded accordingly.
